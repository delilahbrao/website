          Delilah Brao is that girl you can't really figure out. You like her,
          but you don't know why. She's elusive. She's complicated. Sometimes,
          she feels like a walking contradiction. You love that about her. In
          her debut EP, Since You're In New York, Delilah ruminates on long
          distance relationships, heartbreak and starting over. Produced by
          Justin Lucas (Khalid, The Revivalists, Alec Benjamin, Wafia) and mixed
          by Philip Etherington (Lizzy McAlpine, FINNEAS, Laufey, Tiny Habits),
          this folk-pop EP is sparsely and delicately produced to showcase
          Delilah's moving songwriting and ethereal vocals. She's singing about
          herself, and you, and it's still somehow out of reach. Delilah is from
          Boston, MA and is based in Los Angeles, CA. She has collaborated with
          notable writers such as DJ Sabrina The Teenage DJ (credits with The
          1975), lewloh, and Josh Polack (formerly Mom Rock). Delilah's music
          has been praised in Paper Magazine, Stereo Fox, CULTR and more.
